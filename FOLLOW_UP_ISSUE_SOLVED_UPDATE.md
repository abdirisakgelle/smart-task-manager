# Follow-Up Form Update: "Was your issue solved?" Field

## Overview
Added a new required field "Was your issue solved?" to the follow-up form to better track customer satisfaction and automatically handle ticket reopening.

## Changes Made

### Database Changes
1. **Schema Update**: Added `issue_solved BOOLEAN` column to the `follow_ups` table
2. **Migration Script**: Created `server/scripts/add_issue_solved_column.sql` for existing databases
3. **Migration Runner**: Created `server/scripts/run_migration.js` to execute the migration

### Backend Changes
1. **Controller Update**: Modified `server/controllers/followUpsController.js`
   - Added `issue_solved` to required fields validation
   - Updated INSERT and UPDATE queries to include the new field
   - Changed ticket reopening logic to trigger when `issue_solved = false` instead of `satisfied = false`

### Frontend Changes
1. **Form Update**: Modified `client/src/pages/follow-ups/index.jsx`
   - Added "Was your issue solved?" as the first required question with radio buttons (Yes/No)
   - Updated form state to include `issue_solved` field
   - Updated form submission to send the new field
   - Updated success message to reflect the new logic
2. **Dashboard Update**: Modified `client/src/components/DashboardStats.jsx`
   - Updated KPI label from "Follow-up Satisfaction" to "Follow-up Issue Resolution"
   - Updated to use `followUpResolutionRate` instead of `followUpSatisfactionRate`

## New Workflow
1. When a follow-up is submitted, the agent must first answer "Was your issue solved?"
2. If the customer answers "No":
   - The ticket's `resolution_status` is automatically set to 'Reopened'
   - The ticket's `end_time` is cleared (set to NULL)
   - The ticket is reassigned to the original agent
3. All other fields (location, satisfaction, repeated issue, notes) remain unchanged

## Installation Steps
1. Run the database migration:
   ```bash
   cd server/scripts
   node run_migration.js
   ```
2. Test the migration:
   ```bash
   node test_migration.js
   ```
3. Restart the backend server
4. The frontend will automatically use the new form structure

## API Changes
- **POST /api/follow-ups**: Now requires `issue_solved` field in the request body
- **PUT /api/follow-ups/:id**: Now requires `issue_solved` field in the request body
- Response includes `issue_solved` field and `ticket_reopened` flag

## Database Migration
If you have an existing database, run the migration script to add the new column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE follow_ups ADD COLUMN issue_solved BOOLEAN AFTER follow_up_date;
```
