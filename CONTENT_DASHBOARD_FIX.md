# Content Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issue
The content dashboard was showing a 500 error with the message "HTTP error! status: 500" when users with the 'media' role tried to access it.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
The content dashboard was trying to query columns that didn't exist in the database schema:

- **Content Table**: Querying `creator_id` but the table has `director_id`
- **Social Media Table**: Querying `creator_id` and `engagement_rate` but these columns don't exist
- **Ideas Table**: Querying `category` column which doesn't exist

### 2. Missing Test User
There was no test user with the 'media' role to test the content dashboard functionality.

### 3. Missing Employee Link
The media user wasn't linked to an employee record, which is required for the dashboard to work.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Queries
Updated `server/controllers/dashboardController.js` in the `getContentDashboard` function:

```javascript
// Before (causing errors):
FROM content WHERE creator_id = ? AND content_status = 'Completed'
FROM social_media WHERE creator_id = ? AND status = 'published'
SELECT idea_id, title, category, status, submission_date

// After (fixed):
FROM content WHERE director_id = ? AND content_status = 'Completed'
FROM social_media WHERE content_id IN (
  SELECT content_id FROM content WHERE director_id = ?
) AND status = 'published'
SELECT idea_id, title, status, submission_date
```

### 2. Added Media Test User
Updated `server/scripts/add-test-users.js` to include a media user:
- Username: `media`
- Password: `media123`
- Role: `media`

### 3. Created Employee Link
Created `server/scripts/link-media-user.js` to:
- Create an employee record for the media user
- Link the user account to the employee record
- Verify the connection

### 4. Added Sample Content Data
Created `server/scripts/add-sample-content-data.js` to add:
- Sample ideas for the media user
- Sample content records
- Sample social media posts
- This provides realistic data for the dashboard to display

## Files Modified

1. **`server/controllers/dashboardController.js`**
   - Fixed database queries to use correct column names
   - Removed debug logging after fixes

2. **`server/scripts/add-test-users.js`**
   - Added media user to test users array

3. **`server/scripts/link-media-user.js`** (new)
   - Script to link media user to employee record

4. **`server/scripts/add-sample-content-data.js`** (new)
   - Script to add sample content data for testing

## Testing

### Test Credentials
- **Username**: `media`
- **Password**: `media123`
- **Role**: `media`

### Expected Results
- Content dashboard should load without errors
- Should display:
  - Ideas submitted this month
  - Content produced
  - Social media posts
  - Recent ideas list
  - Performance metrics

## Database Schema Notes

The content dashboard now correctly uses the actual database schema:

- **Content Table**: Uses `director_id` instead of `creator_id`
- **Social Media Table**: Uses `content_id` relationship instead of direct `creator_id`
- **Ideas Table**: Removed non-existent `category` column

## Future Improvements

1. **Add missing columns**: Consider adding `creator_id` and `engagement_rate` columns if needed
2. **Real-time data**: Implement real-time updates for dashboard metrics
3. **Performance optimization**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Error handling**: Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
