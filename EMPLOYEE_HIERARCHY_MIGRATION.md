# Employee Organizational Hierarchy Migration

## 📌 Overview

Successfully normalized the employee organizational structure from a simple `department` field to a comprehensive hierarchical system:

**Before:** `Employee → Department`  
**After:** `Employee → Unit → Section → Department`

## 🏗️ Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created

#### 1. **departments** Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

#### 2. **sections** Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE sections (
  section_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### 3. **units** Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE units (
  unit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  section_id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (section_id) REFERENCES sections(section_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Updated **employees** Table
```sql
-- Removed: department VARCHAR(100)
-- Added: unit_id INT with foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN unit_id INT,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (unit_id) REFERENCES units(unit_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

## 🔄 Migration Process

### 1. **Database Migration**
- ✅ Created hierarchy tables (departments, sections, units)
- ✅ Added `unit_id` foreign key to employees table
- ✅ Removed old `department` column
- ✅ Inserted sample organizational data

### 2. **Backend Updates**
- ✅ Created new controllers: `departmentsController.js`, `sectionsController.js`, `unitsController.js`
- ✅ Created new routes: `/api/departments`, `/api/sections`, `/api/units`
- ✅ Updated `employeesController.js` to use JOIN queries with hierarchy
- ✅ Updated `usersController.js` to include hierarchy information

### 3. **Frontend Updates**
- ✅ Updated API slice with new hierarchy endpoints
- ✅ Updated employee filtering logic in content management pages
- ✅ Updated UI to display unit names instead of department names

## 📊 Current Organizational Structure

```
Marcom (Department)
├── Customer Support (Section)
│   └── Agent (Unit)
└── Digital Media (Section)
    ├── Content Creator (Unit)
    ├── Editor (Unit)
    └── Social Media Specialist (Unit)

IT (Department)
└── Administration (Section)
    └── System Admin (Unit)
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Hierarchy Management
```javascript
// Departments
GET    /api/departments                    // Get all departments
GET    /api/departments/:id               // Get department by ID
POST   /api/departments                   // Create department
PUT    /api/departments/:id               // Update department
DELETE /api/departments/:id               // Delete department

// Sections
GET    /api/sections                      // Get all sections with department info
GET    /api/sections/department/:dept_id  // Get sections by department
GET    /api/sections/:id                  // Get section by ID
POST   /api/sections                      // Create section
PUT    /api/sections/:id                  // Update section
DELETE /api/sections/:id                  // Delete section

// Units
GET    /api/units                         // Get all units with hierarchy info
GET    /api/units/section/:section_id     // Get units by section
GET    /api/units/:id                     // Get unit by ID
POST   /api/units                         // Create unit
PUT    /api/units/:id                     // Update unit
DELETE /api/units/:id                     // Delete unit
```

### Updated Employee Endpoints
```javascript
// All employee endpoints now return hierarchy information
GET /api/employees
// Returns: employee_id, name, shift, phone, unit_id, unit, section, department

GET /api/employees/department/:department
// Filters by department name through hierarchy

GET /api/employees/:id
// Returns employee with full hierarchy information
```

## 🎯 Frontend Integration

### API Slice Updates
```javascript
// New hierarchy endpoints added to apiSlice.js
getAllDepartments: builder.query({
  query: () => '/departments',
}),
getAllSections: builder.query({
  query: () => '/sections',
}),
getSectionsByDepartment: builder.query({
  query: (department_id) => `/sections/department/${department_id}`,
}),
getAllUnits: builder.query({
  query: () => '/units',
}),
getUnitsBySection: builder.query({
  query: (section_id) => `/units/section/${section_id}`,
}),
```

### Component Updates
- **Content Management**: Updated employee filtering to use hierarchy
- **New Creative Ideas**: Updated employee filtering to use hierarchy
- **Employee Display**: Now shows unit names instead of department names

## 🔍 Sample Queries

### Get Employee with Full Hierarchy
```sql
SELECT 
  e.employee_id,
  e.name,
  e.shift,
  e.phone,
  e.unit_id,
  u.name AS unit,
  s.name AS section,
  d.name AS department
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN units u ON e.unit_id = u.unit_id
LEFT JOIN sections s ON u.section_id = s.section_id
LEFT JOIN departments d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY e.name
```

### Get Employees by Department
```sql
SELECT 
  e.employee_id,
  e.name,
  e.shift,
  e.phone,
  u.name AS unit,
  s.name AS section,
  d.name AS department
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN units u ON e.unit_id = u.unit_id
LEFT JOIN sections s ON u.section_id = s.section_id
LEFT JOIN departments d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE d.name = ?
ORDER BY e.name
```

## 🔧 Migration Script

The migration was performed using `server/scripts/migrate-employee-hierarchy.js`:

```bash
cd server
node scripts/migrate-employee-hierarchy.js
```

This script:
- ✅ Creates hierarchy tables if they don't exist
- ✅ Adds `unit_id` column to employees table
- ✅ Removes old `department` column
- ✅ Inserts sample organizational data
- ✅ Validates the migration

## 📋 Testing

### API Endpoints Tested
- ✅ `/api/departments` - Returns all departments
- ✅ `/api/sections` - Returns sections with department info

- ✅ `/api/employees` - Returns employees with hierarchy info

### Frontend Integration Tested
- ✅ Content Management page employee filtering
- ✅ New Creative Ideas page employee filtering
- ✅ Employee display with unit names

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Cascading Dropdowns**: Implement dynamic dropdowns for hierarchy selection
2. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk employee assignment to units
3. **Hierarchy Management UI**: Create admin interface for managing hierarchy
4. **Audit Trail**: Track hierarchy changes over time
5. **Role-Based Access**: Implement hierarchy-based permissions

### Migration to Production
1. **Backup**: Always backup existing data before migration
2. **Staging**: Test migration on staging environment first
3. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare rollback strategy if needed
4. **Data Validation**: Verify data integrity after migration

## 📝 Summary

The employee organizational hierarchy has been successfully normalized from a simple department field to a comprehensive three-level hierarchy system. This provides:

- **Better data organization** with clear Department → Section → Unit → Employee relationships
- **Improved scalability** for organizational growth
- **Enhanced data integrity** through proper foreign key constraints
- **Flexible querying** capabilities across all hierarchy levels
- **Future-proof architecture** for complex organizational structures

The migration maintains backward compatibility while providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and organizational growth.
