# Content Dashboard KPIs Fix

## Issue
The content dashboard was showing generic call center KPIs (Tickets Today, Resolution Time, Escalations, Reopened, FCR Rate, Satisfaction) instead of content creation and digital media specific metrics.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Generic DashboardStats
**Before**: Used `<DashboardStats summaryOnly />` which showed call center metrics
**After**: Created content-specific KPI cards

### 2. New Content-Specific KPIs
The content dashboard now shows relevant metrics for content creators and digital media teams:

#### Primary KPIs (4 cards):
- **Ideas Submitted** - Number of ideas submitted this month
- **Content Produced** - Number of completed content pieces
- **Social Posts** - Number of published social media posts
- **Engagement Rate** - Average engagement rate on social media

#### Performance Metrics (3 cards):
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Approval Rate
  - Average Production Time
  - Quality Score
- **Workflow Status**:
  - Pending Ideas
  - In Production
  - Published This Week
- **Social Media Reach**:
  - Total Reach
  - Total Likes
  - Total Shares

### 3. Enhanced Server-Side Data
Updated `getContentDashboard` function to provide:
- Ideas by status (pending, approved, total)
- Content by status (in progress, completed, total)
- Social media posts by platform
- Calculated performance metrics
- Real workflow data instead of mock data

### 4. Improved Recent Ideas Section
- Removed non-existent `category` field
- Added proper date formatting
- Enhanced status display with better color coding

### 5. Conditional Rendering
Added conditional rendering to show:
- Content-specific dashboard when data is available
- Empty state with helpful message when no data exists
