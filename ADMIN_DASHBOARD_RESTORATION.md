       SUM(LOWER(resolution_status) = 'pending') as pending,
       AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, created_at, end_time)) as avg_resolution_time
FROM tickets WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE()

-- Active users
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM users WHERE status = 'active'

-- Employees count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM employees

-- Sections count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM sections
```

### Content Production

WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date

SELECT role, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY role

       COUNT(*) as ideas_submitted,
