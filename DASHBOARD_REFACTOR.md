# Admin Dashboard Refactor - Today's Performance Focus

## Overview
Refactored the admin dashboard to focus exclusively on today's performance metrics, removing legacy fields and percentages in favor of actionable, human-centered KPIs that provide clear visibility into both Call Center and Digital Media operations.

## Key Changes

### üéØ Scope: Today-Only Focus
- All metrics now show data from `CURDATE()` only
- Removed historical percentages and legacy calculations
- Focus on real-time, actionable insights

### üìû Call Center Metrics (5 KPIs)

1. **Tickets Today**
   - Raw count of tickets created today
   - Subtitle: "X marked as Done"
   - Query: `COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE()`

2. **Avg. Resolution Time**
   - Average time in minutes for tickets resolved today
   - Query: `AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, created_at, end_time))` for done tickets today
   - Display: Formatted as "Xm" or "Xh Ym"

3. **Escalations**
   - Count of tickets escalated to supervisor reviews today
   - Query: `COUNT(DISTINCT t.ticket_id)` from tickets + supervisor_reviews join
   - Display: Raw number

4. **Reopened Tickets**
   - Count of tickets marked as "Reopened" today
   - Query: `COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE resolution_status = 'Reopened' AND DATE(created_at) = CURDATE()`
   - Display: Raw number

5. **Customer Satisfaction**
   - Based on today's follow-up data
   - Display: "X/Y" format (Satisfied/Total)
   - Query: `SUM(satisfied = 1)` and `COUNT(*)` from follow_ups today

### üé¨ Digital Media Metrics (4 KPIs)

1. **Ideas Executed**
   - Number of approved ideas submitted today
   - Query: `COUNT(*) FROM ideas WHERE DATE(submission_date) = CURDATE() AND status = 'approved'`
   - Display: Raw number

2. **Content Produced**
   - Number of content items marked as completed
   - Query: `COUNT(*) FROM content WHERE script_status = 'done'`
   - Display: Raw number

3. **Productions Completed**
   - Number of productions completed today
   - Query: `COUNT(*) FROM production WHERE DATE(completion_date) = CURDATE() AND production_status = 'completed'`
   - Display: Raw number

4. **Posts Published**
   - Number of posts published today
   - Query: `COUNT(*) FROM social_media WHERE DATE(post_date) = CURDATE() AND status = 'published'`
   - Display: Raw number

## Removed/Deprecated Features

### ‚ùå Removed KPIs
- Follow-up Issue Resolution (replaced with Customer Satisfaction)
- All percentage-based metrics
- Historical trend calculations
- Reopened Rate percentages
- Publishing Consistency percentages

### ‚ùå Removed Display Elements
- Percentage symbols (%)
- "undefined%" displays
- Complex ratio calculations
- Legacy satisfaction metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`server/controllers/dashboardController.js`)
- Simplified queries to focus on `CURDATE()` only
- Removed percentage calculations
- Updated field names to match new KPI structure
- Added proper null handling with `|| 0` defaults
- Changed time calculations from seconds to minutes

### Frontend Changes (`client/src/components/DashboardStats.jsx`)
- Updated KPI card definitions (9 total cards)
- Changed time formatting function to handle minutes/hours
- Removed percentage displays
- Updated labels and descriptions to be more actionable
- Simplified data mapping (5 Call Center + 4 Digital Media)

### Database Considerations
- Content table lacks `created_at` field ‚Üí uses all content for completion count
- Production table lacks `start_time` ‚Üí uses completion count instead of time calculation
- Ideas table uses `submission_date` for today filtering
- Social media uses `post_date` and `status = 'published'`

## Benefits

- No confusing percentages without context
- Raw numbers enable quick decision-making

### ‚ö° Real-Time Focus

## Future Enhancements

3. **Alert System**

4. **Real-Time Updates**
