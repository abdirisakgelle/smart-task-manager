# 🔒 **Hide Current User Implementation - COMPLETE**

## ✅ **Successfully Implemented**

The currently logged-in admin user is now hidden from the Users Management table.

## 🎯 **Changes Made**

### **1. Updated Filter Logic (Lines 192-203)**
```javascript
// Filter users based on search and filters
const filteredUsers = users.filter(user => {
  const matchesSearch = !searchTerm || 
    user.username.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    (user.employee_name && user.employee_name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()));
  
  const matchesRole = !roleFilter || user.role === roleFilter;
  const matchesStatus = !statusFilter || user.status === statusFilter;
  const isNotCurrentUser = user.user_id !== currentUser?.user_id;  // ← NEW
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesRole && matchesStatus && isNotCurrentUser;  // ← UPDATED
});
```

### **2. Simplified Delete Button (Lines 426-431)**
**Before:** Conditional delete button with current user check
```javascript
{user.user_id !== currentUser?.user_id && (
  <Button ... />
)}
```

**After:** Always show delete button (since current user is filtered out)
```javascript
<Button
  icon="ph:trash"
  onClick={() => handleDeleteUser(user.user_id)}
  className="btn btn-xs btn-outline-danger h-8 w-8 p-0"
  title="Delete User"
/>
```

## 🎨 **Results**

### **Before:**
- Table showed all 3 users including current admin (gelle)
- Delete button was conditionally hidden for current user
- "You" badge next to current user's name

### **After:**
- Table shows only 2 users (excludes current admin)
- All users in table have delete buttons
- No risk of self-modification or deletion
- Cleaner, safer interface

## �� **Impact on UI**

### **Table Header:**
- **Before:** "System Users (3)"
- **After:** "System Users (2)"

### **User Count:**
- **Total users in system:** 3
- **Users shown in table:** 2 (excludes current user)
- **Manageable users:** 2

### **Search & Filters:**
- Work normally on the 2 visible users
- Current user won't appear in search results
- Filters apply only to manageable users

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

1. **🚫 Prevents Self-Deletion** - Admin cannot accidentally delete their own account
2. **🔒 Prevents Self-Role Change** - Admin cannot change their own role
3. **🛡️ Account Protection** - Current admin account is protected from modification
4. **👥 Focus on Management** - Interface focuses on managing other users

## 🚀 **User Experience**

- **Cleaner Interface** - No unnecessary "You" indicators
- **Safer Operations** - No risk of self-modification
- **Better Focus** - Admin focuses on managing other users
- **Consistent Actions** - All visible users have the same action buttons

The implementation is complete and the current user is now safely hidden from the Users Management table! 🎊
