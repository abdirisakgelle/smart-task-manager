# Ticket Volume Chart Improvement

## Overview
Updated the "Daily Ticket Volume" chart to align with Nasiye's operational week (Saturday to Friday) and provide more insightful data visualization for call center supervisors.

## Key Changes

### üéØ Backend Updates (`server/controllers/dashboardController.js`)

**Modified `getDailyTicketVolume` function:**
- Changed from last 7 calendar days to Saturday-to-Friday operational week
- Uses moment.js with Africa/Mogadishu timezone for accurate date calculations

- Returns day names (Saturday, Sunday, Monday, etc.) for better UX

**Key Features:**
- Automatically calculates the current operational week
- Handles timezone conversion properly
- Returns structured data with both date and day name

### üé® Frontend Updates (`client/src/components/partials/widget/chart/DailyTicketVolume.jsx`)

**New Component Features:**
- **Operational Week Focus**: Shows Saturday to Friday instead of calendar days
- **Interactive Info Tooltip**: Hover over the ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon for detailed explanation

What does this chart show?
This bar chart displays how many tickets were created each day for the current operational week (Saturday to Friday).

How do I read it?
Each bar represents a day. Even if no tickets were created on a day, you'll still see a '0' bar ‚Äî ensuring every day is visible.

Why does it matter?
Spot trends like mid-week spikes, weekend slowdowns, or consistent overloads. This helps you plan staffing, balance workloads, and catch issues early.
